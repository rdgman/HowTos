Booting an **HP MicroServer Gen7 or Gen8** from a hard drive connected to a **spare serial port (like the ODD SATA port)** is possible, but it requires some BIOS configuration and potentially a bootloader workaround. Here's a breakdown of how to do it:

---

### üß© Understanding the Challenge

- The **ODD SATA port** (used for optical drives) on the Gen8 is **SATA Port 5**, which **is not bootable by default** in AHCI mode.
- The BIOS typically only allows booting from ports 0‚Äì3 (the main drive bays).
- The **Gen7** has similar limitations but is less flexible than the Gen8.

### ‚úÖ Solution for Gen8: Boot from USB or SD, Load OS from ODD SATA

You can **bootstrap the boot process** using a USB or SD card that contains GRUB, which then loads the OS from the HDD on the ODD port.

#### Steps:
1. **Switch BIOS to AHCI Mode** (not RAID).
2. **Prepare a USB or SD card** with GRUB:
   - Use this GitHub project: [microserver-bootstrap](https://github.com/stefan-golinschi/microserver-bootstrap) [1](https://github.com/stefan-golinschi/microserver-bootstrap)
   - It includes a script `create-disk.sh` to set up the USB/SD card.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/stefan-golinschi/microserver-bootstrap.git
     cd microserver-bootstrap
     sudo ./create-disk.sh /dev/sdX  # Replace sdX with your USB device
     ```

3. **Plug in the USB/SD card**, and set it as the first boot device in BIOS.
4. **Install your OS** (e.g., Ubuntu) on the HDD connected to the ODD port.
5. GRUB on the USB will chainload the OS from the ODD-connected HDD.

### üõ†Ô∏è Alternative for Gen7 (More Limited)

- Gen7 may not support booting from the ODD port at all.
- You can try:
  - Installing the OS on a USB stick and using the ODD HDD as storage.
  - Using a bootloader on USB to redirect to the ODD drive (similar to Gen8).

---

### üß™ Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Remove all other drives** during OS installation to ensure the bootloader installs to the correct device.
- **Replace the CMOS battery** if BIOS settings aren‚Äôt saving.
- **Use `grub-install` manually** if needed:
  ```bash
  sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/usb/boot /dev/sdX
  ```
